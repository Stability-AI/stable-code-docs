# Stable Code Overview

We are Code.AI, Stability AI's research team focused specifically on how to utilize AI to help assist developers be more productive. We currently have the following models available for developers to use directing or build ontop of to create innovative applications:
- [Stable Code](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-code-3b): A base model trained on terabytes of coding, web, and general public web data. This model is best suited to be further finetuned or used for the task of code completion.
- [Stable Code Instruct](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-code-instruct-3b): A finetuned model for the task of instruction following, question and answering, and general chatting tasks with a focus on software engineering. This model is best suited for low code/no code (e.g., build me a website with X, Y, and Z features), explaining error messages, and other conversational task.

To help you get started as fast as possible using and building with Stable Code, we've developed a number of tutorials to showcase standard usecases such as finetuning Stable Code for a new programming language or using Stable Code Instruct to allow developers to ask questions about a software repository. Checkout the various tutorials from the sidebar and we can't wait to see what you build!
